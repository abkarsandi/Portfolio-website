        Technical owner (paired with a project manager). I designed the open-loop control system and wrote
        all embedded code, selected the controller/driver/sensors, and designed the complete power-transmission:
        gear train, shafts, bearing housings, and assembly. Aluminum parts were machined; polymer components were
        3D-printed for cost reduction.

        <li>Integrated sensors: VS1838B IR receiver (remote control) and HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor.</li>
        <li>Wrote all firmware: input handling, motion routines, tuning (current, microstepping, acceleration) to reduce vibration.</li>
        <li>Designed the mechanical transmission: gear ratio & module selection, torque checks, center distances, backlash control.</li>
        <li>Modeled shafts and housings with integrated bearing seats; prepared drawings for machining.</li>

        I calculated the gear train to meet torque and resolution targets, set shaft spacing for proper meshing,
        and designed bearing-seated housings to keep alignment under load. Printed gears used a revised keyway form
        to reduce slip on square hubs.

            The control system was designed as an open-loop stepper motor architecture for simplicity and cost efficiency. I selected an Arduino MEGA as the controller and paired it with a HY-DIV268N-5A driver to operate a NEMA-34 stepper motor. The wiring included an IR receiver (VS1838B) that allowed the system to be remotely controlled, as well as an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for distance feedback and safety margins.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>  
             I carefully tuned the driver’s current limit, microstepping configuration, and acceleration profile to reduce vibration and prevent missed steps under load. The embedded code handled remote commands, sensor readings, and motion routines, ensuring smooth actuation across the transmission. While the system delivered reliable open-loop control, it also highlighted the limitations of using Arduino boards for more advanced tasks such as closed-loop asynchronous functions. This served as both a functioning prototype and a valuable learning platform for control integration in mechatronic systems.

        Aluminum shafts and housings were machined from drawings; polymer gears and fixtures were 3D-printed to
        speed iteration and validate clearances and backlash before final machining.

      <ul>
        <li>Additive parts need larger contact areas to reduce backlash and deformation.</li>
        <li>Arduino-class boards are limiting for closed-loop control due to weak async/task support.</li>
