        I derived the equation of motion of a crank–slider based press with auxiliary links using loop-closure kinematics
        and influence coefficients, then ran a forward dynamics simulation. Different motors (from a catalog), gear ratios,
        and an optional flywheel were evaluated for speed regulation and startup behavior. (RK4/5 with embedded error
        estimate; forming force modeled as a simple harmonic to study its effect on the crank speed.)

      <p>
        The position analysis uses stepwise loop-closure to avoid ambiguous solutions. Dependent coordinates are expressed
        in terms of the generalized coordinate (crank angle), and first/second-order influence coefficients are obtained
        by differentiating the loop equations. These feed the generalized inertia, Coriolis/centripetal terms, and the
        generalized force for the ram/load.

      <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mb-3">Forward Dynamics Setup</h2>
      <p>
        With the kinematics and influence coefficients available, I formed the scalar EOM in the crank coordinate using
        Lagrange’s formulation. Motor torque was supplied from a fitted induction-motor torque–speed curve (catalog data),
        reflected through the gear ratio. A flywheel inertia term could be added to the reflected inertia. Time integration
        used an embedded RK4/5 stepper (RK4 with a 5th-order error estimate) to monitor local error while iterating. The
        forming force on the ram was approximated by a sinusoidal pulse over the lower half of the stroke to examine its
        effect on instantaneous crank speed.

        Below is a representative startup/steady-state trace of crank speed. Runs were repeated for multiple gear ratios
        and flywheel inertias. As expected, the flywheel reduces speed ripple but increases the time to reach steady state.

      <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mb-3">Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding a flywheel decreases deviation from the desired speed, but the system takes longer to reach steady state.</li>
        <li>Lagrange-based analytical dynamics makes EOM derivation straightforward when nonlinear effects (e.g., dry friction) are negligible.</li>
        <li>Torque–speed curves fitted from catalog data integrate well into time-domain simulations and help size the motor/gear ratio.</li>
